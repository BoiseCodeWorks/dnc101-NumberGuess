# NumberGuess
In this challenge you are being tasked with building out a Console Application where the user must guess a random number chosen by the computer between 1-100 inclusive. Each time the user types in a guess the application should be able to notify the user if they need to guess higher, lower, or catch bad input and ask for a valid number. 

At the end of the game the user should be given the number of guesses required to find the correct number.
